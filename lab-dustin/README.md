## Lab-12

#In this lab I have :
- Created an HTTP server using express
- Made an object constructor using mongoose that creates a resource called Hero with three properties: name, origin, id, and goodOrEvil
- Used body-parser middleware on the POST and PUT routes.
- Written tests for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
